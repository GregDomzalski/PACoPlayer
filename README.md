# PACoPlayer

This is a software preservation project with a goal to read and play back video and animation files created with the PICS Animation Compiler (PACo), created by the Company of Science and Art (CoSA).

## Motivations for this project

My personal motivation for this project is to further preserve and explore the 1993 video game title [Iron Helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Helix). Iron Helix was an early CD-rom game that heavily relied on pre-rendered graphics. This allowed the on-rails player navigation to have surprisingly detailed graphics and level design for a game of its era.

All of these pre-rendered graphics were encoded using the PACo Producer software. This can be confirmed in the Iron Helix manual, where they list out all of the software used during the creation of the game.

The PACo project can also be seen as a pre-cursor to both MacroMedia (later Adobe) Shockwave and Flash, as well as Adobe After Effects. When CoSA disbanded, some of the team left for MacroMedia, and the rest for Adobe.

And lastly, reverse engineering is just plain fun.
